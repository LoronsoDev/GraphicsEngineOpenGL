# GraphicsEngineOpenGL

This is a graphics engine able to showcase custom 3D files (with custom extension).
There is no assimp support or any other 3D loader, and it's merely an exercise so I could get myself into a situation where I couldn't rely on 3rd party software.
There are 3D files bundled and the project is ready to compile and execute on Windows.

There is a basic real-time UI made using dockable Dear ImGUI.
